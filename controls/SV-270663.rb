  desc 'Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to privileged functions is greatly increased. 
 
Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication. 
 
Factors include:  
1) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN); 
2) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); and 
3) Something a user is (e.g., biometric). 
 
A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user. 
 
Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the internet). 
 
The DOD common access card (CAC) with DOD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication.
