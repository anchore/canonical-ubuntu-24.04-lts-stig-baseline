Verify Ubuntu 24.04 LTS disables the ability of the user to override the graphical user interface automount setting.

Determine which profile the system database is using with the following command:

$ sudo grep system-db /etc/dconf/profile/user

system-db:local

Check that the automount setting is locked from nonprivileged user modification with the following command:

Note: The example below is using the database "local" for the system, so the path is "/etc/dconf/db/local.d". This path must be modified if a database other than "local" is being used.

$ grep 'automount-open' /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*

If the command does not return at least the example result, this is a finding.)
