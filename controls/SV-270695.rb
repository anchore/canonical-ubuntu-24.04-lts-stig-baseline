Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization. 
 
Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS will not have to verify the software again. This requirement does not mandate DOD certificates for this purpose; however, the certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved CA.'
