This requirement applies to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with software libraries that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs that execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.'

Note: The above command uses awk to filter out common system accounts. If your system uses other required system accounts, add them to the awk condition to filter them out of the results.

If any system commands are returned that are not group-owned by a required system account, this is a finding.)
