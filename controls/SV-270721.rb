Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.  
  
Factors include:   
1) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN);  
2) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); and  
3) Something a user is (e.g., biometric).  
  
A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.  
  
Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the internet).  
  
The DOD common access card (CAC) with DOD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication.'
