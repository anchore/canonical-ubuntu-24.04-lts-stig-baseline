Enabling a FIPS mode on a pre-existing system involves a number of modifications to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Refer to the Ubuntu Pro security certification documentation for instructions.  
 
A subscription to the "Ubuntu Pro" plan is required to obtain the FIPS Kernel cryptographic modules and enable FIPS.

Note: Ubuntu Pro security certification instructions can be found at: https://ubuntu.com/security/certifications/docs/fips-enablement

The basic steps use the following commands:

$ sudo pro attach <token>
$ sudo pro enable fips-updates'
