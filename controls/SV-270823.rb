Operating systems providing tools to interface with audit information will leverage user permissions, roles identifying the user accessing the tools, and the corresponding user rights to make decisions regarding access to audit tools. 
 
Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.
