Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, audit reports) needed to successfully audit Ubuntu 24.04 LTS system activity.

A system reboot would be noticeable, and a system administrator could then investigate the unauthorized changes.'

If the "enabled" value returned is not "2", this is a finding.

Verify that the audit system is configured to be immutable across reboots with the following command:

$ grep -E '^-e 2' /etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules
/etc/audit/rules.d/99-finalize.rules:-e 2

If the "-e 2" option is not configured in a rules file under "/etc/audit/rules.d/", this is a finding.)

Create or edit a finalized rules file (e.g., "/etc/audit/rules.d/99-finalize.rules") and append the following option as the absolute last line:

Compile and load the new rules into the active kernel:

$ sudo augenrules --load

Note: Once this rule is active, further changes to the audit configuration will be blocked. A system reboot will be required to apply any future audit rule modifications.'
